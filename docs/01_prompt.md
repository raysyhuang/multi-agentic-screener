My goal is to achieve a 5-10% return per trade. By compounding that return approximately 7-100 times, I can potentially reach 100 to 1,000 multiples.
If I can execute this in a short period—such as short-term trades lasting 5-7 days, 10-15 days, or even less than a month—I should be able to achieve a tenfold return, or at least double to triple my capital within a year. If this strategy proves consistent, I can apply it for the long term.
My plan to achieve this involves:
1. Finding one to two of the most promising candidates from the US Stock Exchange (including the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ).
2. Using a multi-agentic project to perform the following:(a) Scan(b) Analyze© Validate(d) Predict
Continue C to validate, D to predict, and E to backtest. This project provides one to two candidate tickers per day. Although I might not trade every day, I want to ensure I have one to two of the most promising candidates available. This allows us to verify over time if these candidates are promising: are they reliable, consistent, and effective in making predictions and providing quality results?
I have listed a good number of apps that I find online, including the two apps I built (KooCore-D and others). However, I find that they are not multi-agentic; they use older technology, or perhaps a single AI agent.
I believe that in the future, everything will be multi-agent. This approach allows for:
1. Cross-validation of data
2. Executing tasks in parallel
3. Using sophisticated Large Language Model abilities to analyze results and verify if they make sense.
I also want this multi-agent system to perform an automatic analysis every day. I haven’t decided whether I want to host it online using a service like Heroku, or host it locally using established multi-agentic tools such as:
1. Cursor
2. Claude Code
3. Codex

⠀These tools are already connected to many skills and MCPs, and they utilize large language models like Claude Opus 4.6, which is the latest and best model I’m going to use.
All the apps and ideas I have mentioned are suggestions that I want to incorporate, but I’m not limited to just these. Please help me brainstorm to make this a very good app for a short-term screener. I’ll use the results every day (typically one or two tickers) to use in my trades if I decide to use them.
Since we are using multiple agentic projects, what other potential abilities can these projects use that I don’t know yet? I’m not sure how tools like Manus or other agents are better compared to simply using large language models for tasks like:
1. Self-learning
2. Self-improvement
3. Parallel execution
4. Using multiple agents with different large language models for different purposes

⠀Additionally, I don’t want the frontend to be streamed. I want the frontend to be clean, easy to understand, and easy to use (like a good JavaScript or JS frontend). Please don’t use Streamlit, which is ugly and slow.
There are several multi-agentic frameworks already online that we can learn from, such as Trading-R1 or FinGPT. We can learn from them and potentially adopt their strengths.
We should also learn from other online all-in-one platforms, including:
1. Quant AI engines
2. Supporting libraries (which I already have)
3. Large language model APIs in my .env file

⠀I have the API for…
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
OPENAI_API_KEY
GEMINI_API_KEY
POLYGON_API_KEY 
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID
FMP_API_KEY
ADANOS_API_KEY
FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY
DATABASE_URL

For the multi-agent project, I hope that it has the function to use the web browser, search functions, MCPs, and skills (similar to Claude, Cursor, or Code). 

I am also considering whether I should:
1. Build a brand new app project
2. Build a remote, multi-agent project that uses Claude or Cursor every day, since they already have all these functions and abilities

Anyways, I'm just brainstorming ideas. I want to build a high-quality project that fits my goal and can run automatically every day, whether online or offline. It needs to be:
1. Strong
2. Predictable
3. Effective
4. Consistent
5. Reliable

Help me do the brainstorming.
